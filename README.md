**## Recommendations**

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**
I believe the next step in their advancement is to educate people on these technologies.
Robo Advisor could be introduced by the company to help the individual with little to no background in finance to help them in deciding which stock or portfolio to invest
They could also hire financial advisors that could help the company in building different categories of Portfolios for the general public to choose from.
They could also introduce education material on their website for people to get trained on before they dive into the world of trading using automated tools.


**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
It would bring more users to the company as people will be more inclined to learn it and then use it, this will also increase their customer retention rate, considering few people will decide to leave if fewer people make a loss in their trades.

Since Robinhood, 50% revenue is accumulated from the Payment for order flow (PFOF) strategy, meaning directing the orders to different parties and receiving a small compensation and benefit against it.

Having more users to their web platform with better knowledge will increase their overall revenue as well, as people will have more understanding in investing by managing a portfolio of stocks rather than investing in individual ones.

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
Robo Advisor, Education platform, Online Help Tutor, Financial Advisors

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
These technologies have already been utilized by many organizations that have great success in implementing their overall strategy, leading to more revenue generation and making the core process more effective and efficient.
In other words, History speaks for itself.
